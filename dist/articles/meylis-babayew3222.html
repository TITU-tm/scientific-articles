				Exploring the Power and Limitations of Neural Networks in Machine Learning
			</h1>
			<p class="pb-4">
				Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is modeled after the structure and function of
				the human brain. They are used to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data, and have been
				applied to a wide range of applications including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech
				recognition.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				The basic building block of a neural network is a neuron, which takes in input data and produces an output
				based on a set of weights and biases. These weights and biases are adjusted during the training process to
				optimize the network's performance on a given task.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				There are several types of neural networks, including feedforward networks, recurrent networks, and
				convolutional networks. Feedforward networks are the simplest type, where information flows in one direction
				from input to output. Recurrent networks allow for feedback loops, where the output of one neuron can be fed
				back into the network as input. Convolutional networks are used for image recognition tasks, where the
				network learns to recognize features in images by applying filters to different parts of the image.
				One of the advantages of neural networks is their ability to learn from data without being explicitly
				programmed. This makes them useful for tasks where it is difficult to define a set of rules or algorithms to
				follow. However, this also means that the quality of the output is highly dependent on the quality of the
				input data and the design of the network architecture.
			</p>
			<p class="pb-4">
				Neural networks have been used in a wide range of applications, including self-driving cars, speech
				recognition, and medical diagnosis. However, they also have some limitations. They can be computationally
				expensive to train and require large amounts of data. Additionally, they can be difficult to interpret,
				making it hard to understand how they arrived at a particular decision.
				Overall, neural networks are a powerful tool in machine learning and have many practical applications. As
				technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see even more uses for this technology in the
				future.
